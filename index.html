                    <p>Hi, I am Nguyen Le passionate in a career as a Full Stack Web Developer to further enhance and demonstrate my abilities to build frontend and backend technologies. 
                    What first introduced me to code is my drive to build my very own website from scratch. 
                    It started by learning through basic online tutorials and videos on HTML, CSS, and Javascript where I then decided I wanted to learn both frontend and backend coding languages. 
                    I have completed several projects on Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer course and currently attend a coding bootcamp at UC Davis Extension to build on my skills and gain more experience and knowledge as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>My interests include fitness, art, adventures, technology, sports, food, music, and exploring and learning new things.</p>

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!-- Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:



A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)


eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On md and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid


Responsive images


BONUS
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)


Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
